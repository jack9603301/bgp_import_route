# bgp_import_route

This is a large routing table, and the accompanying script can provide hot standby switching. This is only a technical practice and demonstration script, not a ready-to-use script. The actual use needs to modify the code part. You can use it to identify traffic, forward VPN data, and integrate with vyos. Please do not use this code for illegal purposes. We will not be responsible for all legal consequences of using this code to commit illegal crimes
